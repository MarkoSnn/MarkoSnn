- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarkoSnn
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and editing videos for the most part. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and C++ aswell as SQL and JS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some random projects that I've got in my mind and want to implement into reality.
- 📫 How to reach me won't really be needing that.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I suck at programming that's why I want to learn from the work of others.
